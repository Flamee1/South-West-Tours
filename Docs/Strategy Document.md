# Strategy Document

The Explorers Southwest website should directly relate to users who are looking for adventurous holiday trips in America, from march to October.
The target audience, not limited to

*	Families
*	Couples
*	Photographers
*	Young adults
*	Retired adults
*	Tourist of all ages

 Who are interested in hiking, slow paddle boarding, fishing, kayaks, nature/outdoors, but not excluded to. There are also special trips to ghost mines, which could be suitable for the younger generation that would not find hiking or nature interesting.

 The site as a whole should include light colours. Starting with where the users will first land when entering. Which should be the home age. Which must be punchy and concise so that the users know what the site is within the first 10 seconds, this is important because a former study has shown that the average person only stays on a site for 2 minutes 17 seconds (reference here). The site will also feature heavily with photographs of nature, exploring and people enjoying themselves.
