# Strategy Document

The Explorers Southwest website should directly relate to users who are looking for adventurous holiday trips in America, from March to October.

The target audience, not limited to

*	Families
*	Couples
*	Nature Photographers
* Nature enthusiast
*	Young adults
*	Retired adults
*	Tourist, of all ages from outside America
* Client

The aim of the site is to sell a wider range of packages of to the target audience that are listed above. The client wants to develop their site so that they can provide a renting service for equitment for people who want to go on a trip but don't want to be confidiefed to a tour and they also want to have luxery camping sites to hire out.

Who are interested in hiking, stand-up paddle boarding, fishing, kayaking, nature/outdoors, but not excluded to. There are also special trips to ghost mines, which could be suitable for the younger generation that would not find hiking or nature interesting.

The site as a whole should include light natural colours. Starting with where the users will first land when entering. Which should be the home page. Which must be punchy and concise so that the users know what the site is within the first 10 seconds, this is important because a former study has shown that the average person only stays on a site for 2 minutes 17 seconds (reference here). The site will also feature heavily with photographs of nature, exploring and people enjoying themselves.
